<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="./p01.c">
      Write a program to check whether a string given by the user is Palindrome or not.
    </a>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="./p02.c">
    Write a program to read a string and find the number of words in the string, using return type function.
    </a>
  </li>
     
  <li>
    <a href="./p03.c">
    Write a program to read a string, pass it to a non-return type function that finds the longest word in the string, counts the number of
    vowels and consonants in the string. Display the counts and the longest word in the main function.
    </a>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="./p04.c">
    Write a program to reverse a string using recursion.
    </a>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Write a program using recursion to find:<br>
    <a href="./p05a.c">
    a)  Write a program to simulate the task of strlen function. Create a separate user defined function to find the length.<br>
    </a>
    <a href="./p05b.c">
    b)  Write a program to simulate the task of strcat function. Create a separate user defined function, duplicating the strcat function.<br>
    </a>
    <a href="./p05c.c">
    c)  Write a program to simulate the task of strcpy function. Create a separate user defined function, duplicating the strcpy function, without the return string functionality.<br>
    </a>
    <a href="./p05d.c">
    d)  Write a program to simulate the task of strcmp function. Create a separate user defined function, duplicating the strcmp function.<br>
    </a>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="./p06.c">
    Write a program that will read a string and rewrite it in alphabetical order.<br>
    For example, the world NEPAL should be written as AELNP.
    </a>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="./p07.c">
    Write a program that will read a string and a character. Find the frequency of the character in the string.
    </a>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="./p08.c">
    Write a program to read a string and find the frequency of all the characters in the string.
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="./p09.c">
    Write a program to read a string from the user and swap the case of each character of the string. Convert uppercased letters to lower and vice versa.
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="./p10.c">
    Write a program to read the name of 10 students store them in an array. Pass the array to a function which sorts the name array. Display the sorted array in main function.
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="./p11.c">
    Write a program which performs the following tasks:<br>
   </a>
  </li>
  
  
  ```
  - ask the question "Who is the creator of the C programming langauge?"
  - print "CORRECT!" if the answer is correct
  - print "INCORRECT, TRY AGAIN" if the answer is wrong and ask the question again
  - print the correct answer if the answer is wrong even at the third attempt and stop
  ```
